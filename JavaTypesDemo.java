  /* there are two categories of types in Java: 
  - primitive types
  - reference types
  The primitive types are the boolean type and the numeric types which include byte, short, int, long, char, float and double. 
    The term "primitive" in Java refers to a data type that is not an object and has no methods. 
    Primitive types are the most basic data types available within the Java language. 
    They serve as the building blocks of data manipulation in Java and contain pure, simple values of a kind.
  The reference types include class types, interface types and array types.
    Reference types are types that are defined by a class or an interface. 
    They are called reference types because they refer to objects.
